﻿﻿# Technical DocumentationSince Harvard Library's [aspace-hvd-pui](https://github.com/harvard-library/aspace-hvd-pui) plugin was the inspiration for IAS's Archive Center, a lot of the code was adapted from that plugin as a starting point.   ## CSS workIn order to implement IAS's desired color and icon choices,  two `.sccs` files were edited, and the resulting `assets\ias_application.css` was created by using *node-sass*, a Windows application.  In addition, ias.css was created to fine-tune the appearance.## Terminology workSeveral elements from the core `locales/en.yml` file are overridden.## ViewsMost of the deviations in the `views/` subdirectories are solely in support of the different presentation requested.  However, here is one partial view file, `views/objects/show.html.erb` that has a decent amount of ruby code to handle the display of a single Digital Object within the context of a collection by relating it to its Archival Object, if any. This code determines the breadcrumbs as well as properly indicating where in the left-hand hierarchy the Digital Object belongs.## Overriding Controller BehaviorIncluded in that adaptation were several methods in `plugin_init.rb` that override behavior in some of the core code's controller behavior, as well as the extension of the `controllers/resources.rb` by `archivesspace_ui/public/controllers/resources_addons_controller.rb`, which methods are accessed by extending the `routes.rb`.
